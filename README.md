## COVIDITY Project - Probabalistic bias analysis for selection bias in COVID-19 testing

This repository contains the scripts needed to perform the main analyses described in the associated paper ("Accounting for bias due to outcome data missing not at random: comparison and illustration of two approaches to probabilistic bias analysis: a simulation study"). This includes scripts to generate the simulated datasets and then analyse these simulations, plus scripts applying these methods to UK Biobank data.

Code for the Not-At-Random Fully Conditional Specification (NARFCS) method is available in both R (.r) and Stata (.do), while code for the Bayesian selection model method is only available in R and JAGS.

Note also that these scripts were predominantly run on the University of Bristol's High-Performance Computing suite (https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/high-performance-computing/). The shell scripts to run these jobs on this system have not been included here.

### Simulation study

#### Data simulation
- "Master do file for simulating datasets.do" simulates datastes of 4 types:

(I) selection model (SM) factorisation and not null exposure effect,

(II) selection model factorisation and null exposure effect,

(III) pattern-mixture model (PMM) factorisation and not null exposure effect,

(IV) pattern-mixture model factorisation and null exposure effect,

- (I AND II)
	- "SM - sets true values of data generation models.do"
	- "SM - generates simulated datasets.do"
	- "SM - simulates a dataset.do"
- (III AND IV)
	- "PMM - sets true values of data generation models.do"
	- "PMM - generates simulated datasets.do"
	- "PMM - simulates a dataset.do"

- "PMM - generates large dataset for true exposure effect value.do" generates very large dataset to determine "TRUE" exposure effect for PMM data model

#### Data analysis
- Stata .do scripts to generate random seeds for each of the analyses in both the SM DGM ("RandomSeeds.do") and PMM DGM ("RandomSeeds_PMM.do")
- Scripts to perform the complete-cases analyses, multiple imputation, inverse probability weighting and NARFCS analyses on the simulated datasets, and then combine the simulated results together, in both R ("NARFCS_Simulations.r") and Stata ("NARFCS_Simulations_Stata.do")

##### Bayesian SM
- "BayesSM_Simulations.r" contains R code to perform the Bayesian selection model using JAGS on the simulated datasets
- spreadsheet files list generated random seeds (*.csv)

### UK Biobank study
 - "UKBB_Processing.r" processes the UK Biobank data ready for analysis
 - Scripts to perform the complete-cases analyses, multiple imputation, inverse probability weighting, coding all participants without COVID testing data as 'not infected' and NARFCS analyses on the UK Biobank data, in both R ("NARFCS_UKB.r") and Stata ("NARFCS_UKB_Stata.do")
 - "NARFCS_UKB.r" contains R code to perform the NARFCS quantitative bias analysis, along with other methods (complete-case analysis, inverse probability weighting [stabilised and unstabilised], standard multiple imputation, and coding all participants without COVID testing data as 'not infected')
 - "BayesSM_UKB.r" contains R code to perform the Bayesian selection model using JAGS on the UK Biobank data
